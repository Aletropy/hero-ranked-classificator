# Hero Level Classifier Challenge

## Overview

This project is a challenge to classify a hero's level based on the amount of experience (XP) they have. By using basic programming constructs like variables, operators and decision structures, the program will determine and display the hero's level according to the XP input.

## XP Classification

- **Less than 1,000 XP**: Iron
- **1,001 - 2,000 XP**: Bronze
- **2,001 - 5,000 XP**: Silver
- **5,001 - 7,000 XP**: Gold
- **7,001 - 8,000 XP**: Platinum
- **8,001 - 9,000 XP**: Ascendant
- **9,001 - 10,000 XP**: Immortal
- **10,001 XP or more**: Radiant

## How to Use

1. Input the hero's name.
2. Input the hero's XP.
3. The program will output the corresponding hero level based on the XP.
